For configuring analog input on the CIM10, there are two pins available, supporting up to two analog channels at maximum. Various parameters need configuration such as Range, Destination, Sampling Rate, Debug, NumOfChannels, Enable, Pin Number, Channel Type, Name, Peripheral ID, EnggLowCal, EnggHighCal, Scalelow, and Scalehigh. These parameters facilitate effective calibration, configuration, and conversion of raw and engineering values.

For instance, if configuring a field device with a 4-20mA output on AI pin, the configuration settings on CIM10 would include:
| Parameter           | Value                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Pin Number          | 1                                        |
| Sampling rate (Sec) | 1 to 86400                               |
| Destination         | CIMCON Cloud                             |
| Name                | User-defined                             |
| Device ID           | User-defined                             |
| Channel Type        | Current (I)                              |
| Engg. Scale Low     | 4                                        |
| Engg. Scale High    | 20                                       |
| Scale Low           | read the and fill here   |
| Scale High          | read the and fill here   |

Or, if the channel is a voltage channel:

| Parameter           | Value                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Pin Number          | 1                                        |
| Sampling rate (Sec) | 1 to 86400                               |
| Destination         | CIMCON Cloud                             |
| Name                | User-defined                             |
| Device ID           | User-defined                             |
| Channel Type        | Voltage (V)                              |
| Engg. Scale Low     | 0                                        |
| Engg. Scale High    | 10                                       |

For configuring digital input on the CIM10, there are two pins available, supporting up to two digital channels at maximum. Parameters such as range, Sampling Rate, Debug, Number Of Channel, and Device ID need configuration.

| Parameter           | Value                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Pin Number          | 1                                        |
| Sampling rate (Sec) | 1 to 86400                               |
| Destination         | CIMCON Cloud                             |
| Pin Name            | User-defined                             |
