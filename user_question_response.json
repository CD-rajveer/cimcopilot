{"user_question": "no", "response": "## CIM10 Analog Input Configuration: Understanding Scale Low/High\n\nFrom the context, I understand you're working with a flow meter that outputs a 4-20mA signal, and you want to scale this to 0-100% on the CIM10. You've correctly set the Engineering Low/High values to 4 and 20, respectively. Now, let's clarify the Scale Low/High parameters.\n\n**Scale Low/High define the range within your desired units (percentage in this case) that correspond to the 4-20mA engineering range.**\n\nSince you want 4mA to represent 0% and 20mA to represent 100%, your configuration should be:\n\n* **Scale Low:** 0 \n* **Scale High:** 100\n\n**Therefore, your final AI configuration in YAML format would be:**\n\n```yaml\nai_config:\n  publisher:\n    destination: []\n    sampling_rate: 60\n    debug: 0\n  aiChannel:\n    - Enable: 1\n      pinno: 1\n      ChannelType: I\n      EnggLowCal: 4\n      EnggHighCal: 20\n      Scalelow: 0\n      Scalehigh: 100\n      Name: add\n      peripheral_id: \"1234567891234567899\"\n      uuid: \"6b46bd14-061d-11ef-b228-60b6e10ad793\"\n```\n\n**Do you have any other questions about configuring the analog input or any other aspect of the CIM10?** \n"}
